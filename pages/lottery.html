                                Yes. This is a new program offered through Mayor Bill de Blasio through NYC Housing Preservation and Development.
                                Moderate Income families have also been priced out of the market, so this new program was developed to target
                                moderate income households. As long as your combined income is within the income range and matching household
                                size stated in the Affordability chart then you have the possibility to qualify. The common rule of thumb
                                is for housing to be affordable, households should spend no more than one-third of their income on rent and
                                utilities.
